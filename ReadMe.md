## Steps to Build, Run, and Test the Docker Container from your Local System.

### 1. Build the Docker Image 
- In the root directory of your project (where the Dockerfile is located), run the following command to build the Docker image:
```docker build -t united-airlines-api .```
- -t united-airlines-api: This tags the Docker image as united-airlines-api.
- .: The dot represents the current directory, which contains the Dockerfile.

### 2. Run the Docker Container 
- Once the image is built successfully, you can run the Docker container with the following command:
```docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name united-airlines-api-container united-airlines-api```
- -d: Runs the container in detached mode (in the background).
- -p 8080:8080: Maps port 8080 of your local machine to port 8080 in the container.
- --name united-airlines-api-container: Names the container for easier management.
- united-airlines-api: Specifies the image name that was built in the previous step.

### 3. Check the Running Container 
- Verify that the container is running by using the command:
```docker ps```
- This will show all running containers and their associated ports. You should see your united-airlines-api-container listed, with 8080 mapped.

### 4. Test the API 
- Now, you can test the API locally using Postman, curl, or a web browser.
- Using curl (for example to test GET /api/flights): ```curl http://localhost:8080/api/flights```
- If the server is running correctly, you should get a response from your API, such as a list of flights.
